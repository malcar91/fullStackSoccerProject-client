## Planning Story
I designed the wireframe to give me a good idea of the layout that I wanted to achieve. Then I started with my forms and auths, sign-in, sign-up, change-password and log out. Once those where tested and working I moved onto client user side of the site so creating an item and updating the same item. After that I would then add more functionality to the site and style.

### User Story

User will come to the page and see welcome header with sign up and login in menus. New users will sign up and returning users will just have to log in.
Once logged in a user will be able to choose the country of which league they follow, choose the league within the country and then pick their club.
Once picked their team, there it would show upcoming games and past results.
In the future, highlights of the games would be present as well or links to where you can find the highlights for the game. Which players started and got subbed on.

### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- bootstrap
- flexbox

### Unsolved Problems

- I can't get the teams to update, I tried few different ways and ended up with different error messages.
- Since I couldn't get the teams to update there is not a delete button yet.
- I still have to work on displaying the information properly once creating a team.
- Still have to work on getting index to work, so show everything created.
